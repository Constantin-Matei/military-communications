## Briefly

In military operations, communication is a key element in the success of missions. That is why it is very important that the communication is clear and efficient. In order not to have errors that endanger either the mission or human lives, the communication has been standardized with the help of a phonetic alphabet since 1913. In the following you will see different forms of transmission of military messages.
